#quick 4
This application is similar to quick3 and it shows us one big green centered rectangle which is surrounded by 8 other rectangles from the side. 
The window has slider on top and when you slide it all the rectangles are rotated according to value. 
It also includes mouse click event. If the big green rectangle is pressed, its width and height should shrink and some of the other along with it.
