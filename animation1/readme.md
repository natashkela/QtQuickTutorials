#animation1 

This is a first time try to make an animation using qt quick and image resources. There are several images in the resources but one
we use is called rotation, which goes on to the background and rotates the image 360 infinitely after the first click in the body is made. 
To check out how it looks, please download how_does_it_look mp4
