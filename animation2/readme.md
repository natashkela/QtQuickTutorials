#animation2

This is a second animation project that includes external and internal animations. The project taught me how to use NumberAnimation and
ColorAnimation. RotationAnimator was already used in previous projects, therefore it was not new. 
It also introduced me to the concept of Parallel animation that happens in Qt automatically. For more details of how the project looks, 
please look at how_does_it_look3.mp4
